# BertTrainingWithVisualExplain

BertTrainingWithVisualExplain is a Python-based project designed to facilitate the training and fine-tuning of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) models with an integrated visual explanation module. This repository offers a way to not only train and evaluate BERT models but also generate visual insights to interpret model decisions. The aim is to make NLP model predictions more interpretable for developers, researchers, and end-users by providing visual explanations of how the model weighs input tokens.

## Overview

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) has become a foundational model in NLP, enabling state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. However, BERT's decision-making process remains a black box, often hard to interpret due to its large number of layers and complex attention mechanisms.

BertTrainingWithVisualExplain addresses this issue by incorporating visualization tools, making it easier to interpret and understand the attention patterns within BERT during both training and inference stages. This allows users to gain insights into which tokens the model considers most relevant in its decision-making.

## Features

- **BERT Training and Fine-tuning**: Easily train or fine-tune BERT on custom datasets for specific NLP tasks.
- **Attention Visualizations**: Generate attention heatmaps and token importance plots to better understand how BERT interprets input sequences.
- **Customizable Attention Layers**: Choose which attention layers to visualize for a more granular understanding of BERT's internal mechanics.
- **Modular Architecture**: Simple, modular code structure that makes it easy to add custom training loops, visualizations, or model layers.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BertTrainingWithVisualExplain.git
   cd BertTrainingWithVisualExplain
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download BERT model** (Optional): By default, the project uses the pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Faceâ€™s `transformers` library. You can also specify a custom model in the configuration file.

## Usage

### 1. Training a BERT Model

To train BERT on your dataset, use the following command:

```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
```

This script will load your data, prepare the BERT model, and begin the training process according to the parameters specified in `config.yaml`.

### 2. Generating Visual Explanations

After training, you can use `visual_explain.py` to generate visualizations for attention weights. Run the following command:

```bash
python visual_explain.py --input "Your input sentence here" --config config.yaml
```

This will generate a heatmap or token importance plot based on the attention weights of the specified layers. The output images will be saved in the `visualizations` directory.

### 3. Example Notebooks

For a step-by-step guide, explore the example Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory. These notebooks provide an overview of training, evaluation, and generating visual explanations.

## Configuration

All parameters for training, evaluation, and visualization are defined in `config.yaml`. Here are some key parameters:

- **`model`**: Path to the pre-trained BERT model or model name (e.g., `bert-base-uncased`).
- **`data_path`**: Path to the dataset (in CSV format).
- **`batch_size`**: Training batch size.
- **`num_epochs`**: Number of training epochs.
- **`attention_layers`**: List of attention layers to visualize (e.g., `[0, 5, 11]`).
- **`output_dir`**: Directory to save model checkpoints and visualizations.

You can adjust these parameters to customize the training and visualization process.
